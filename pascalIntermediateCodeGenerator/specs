Hi
I've added a few more to the list you've mentioned .

        This is not required to implement .(I will confirm this with
prof and let you know )

   4) Type checking in cases like function arguments , operands of
same type in any statement

  5) Arrays :- Out of bounds  or index not being an integer

   6) Possibly variable re-declaration

These are the things which I can think of now. Additionally if prof
wants some more cases to be handled , I'll let you know .
